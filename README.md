## About this banch

In this branch I'm experimenting with different ways to visualize the acceleration data of a child to see if I'm able to see in the visualization when the child switches between waking and sleeping.

As of right now the focus series_id that I'm visualizing is `08db4255286f`

The notebook of interest here is [visualizer.ipynb](visualizer.ipynb) notebook. This is a recent visualization I produced on the data
