## About this banch

In this branch I wrote some basic code to try and visualize a child's activity given their `series_id`. Run 

```sh
python visual.py
```

to see the visualization.

As of right now the focus series_id that I'm visualizing is `08db4255286f`

Another thing to check out in this branch would be the [visualizer.ipynb](visualizer.ipynb) notebook. Its last cell  has a demo for what I'm trying to make the every frame look like
